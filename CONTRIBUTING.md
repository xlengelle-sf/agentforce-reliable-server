# Contributing to AgentForce Reliable Server

We love your input! We want to make contributing to AgentForce Reliable Server as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## Pull Requests

1. Update the README.md and DOCUMENTATION.md with details of changes if appropriate
2. Update examples and tests if applicable
3. The PR should work for Node.js 16.x and above
4. Ensure the code passes all tests

## Coding Style

- We use ESLint to ensure consistent code style
- Please follow the existing style patterns in the codebase
- For TypeScript code, ensure types are properly declared

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the project's MIT License.

## Setting Up Development Environment

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Make your scripts executable:
   ```bash
   npm run setup
   ```
4. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
5. Test your changes locally:
   ```bash

## Reporting Bugs

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Feature Requests

We love hearing new ideas! Please open an issue with the tag "enhancement" to request new features.
